What's the difference between a function value/lambdas and a closure? Give examples of both.

- A function value/lambdas is an anonymous function which is simply a function with no name, that can be assigned to variable or passed to another function as an argument. 

For example using lambdas in PHP:

$sayHello = function () {
  return "Hello";
}

echo $sayHello();

In the code above, we assigned anonymous function to a variable $sayHello. When variable $sayHello() is called, it should return "Hello". 


- In the other hand, a closure is essentially the same as a Lambda apart from it can access variables outside the scope that it was created. 

For example using closure in PHP:

$name = "Mike";

$sayHello = function() use ($name) {
	echo "Hello $name";
};

$sayHello();

In the code above, the closure can access the $name variable because $name was declared in use clause of the closure function. Also, if you change the $name variable in the closure, it will not effect the original variable.
