What is applicative order? Give a working example to illustrate this in a language of your choice.
Discuss here, but put the code in a separate file with proper extension. Ensure the code works.

Applicative order is an evaluation strategy in which evaluates function arguments before passing them to a function. 

For example of applicative order in Scala. 

object Main {
  def byValue(a: Unit) = {
    for (i <- 0 until 10) {println(a)}

  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    var i = 1;
 
    byValue(i = i + 1)
    println(i);
 
  }
}

The final value of i after the function byValue() is called is 2. It is because the applicative order will evaluate i = i + 1 before pass it to funtion byValue().
