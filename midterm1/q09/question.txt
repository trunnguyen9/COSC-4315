max = 100

is an expression or a statement in Ruby? Explain.

Answer:

In this case, the value 100 is assigned to max, and the value of the assignment which is 100 is returned. Since it returns a value, it is considered an expression. An expression performs some works, then finally returns a value. In contrast, a statement does not.

We can test to see if max = 100 actually returns 100 by writing a little of code as below:
puts max = 100;

The result will be that 100 will be printed to the console.
