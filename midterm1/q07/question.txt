Given a number n, the factorial of a number is defined as the product 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n.
Assume n is >= 1 (do not do any checks for n < 1).

Write fully working code in one language of your choice, in a separate file with proper extension.
Write three separate functions (in one file):

1. Implement factorial using regular recursion.

2. Implement factorial using tail call optimized recursion (using native feature, not extensions).

3. Implement factorial without using recursion and without any mutability.
