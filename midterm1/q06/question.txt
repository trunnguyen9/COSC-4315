Given a function sort (not in any particular language)

sort(list) {
  if (list.isEmpty) 
     return [] 
  else {
    pivot = list.head
    tail = list.tail

    return sort(tail.filter { e => e < pivot } ++ 
      pivot ++ 
      sort(tail.filter { e => e >= pivot}))
  }
}

In the above sample pseudocode ++ means concatenate a list with an element or another list.

First implement the above recursive solution in a functional or hybrid functional language of your choice. Then, show another tail recursive (tail call optimized) implementation (don't implement a different sorting algorithm, simply turn the recursive solution into a tail recursion).

Keep the two versions of your code in two separate files with proper extensions.
