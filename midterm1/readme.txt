The midterm has ten questions, each carrying equal points. Please answer each 
question in their individual directories. You can create any files necessary 
for each question in their respective directories. Files outside the 
directories for each question will not be graded.
                        
Please check in your answers frequently so you don't lose them.
You can check them in any number of times. Only the last check in for each 
question will be used for grading purpose. The svn repository will accept your 
checkins until 8:30PM.
