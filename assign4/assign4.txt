Assignment 4: Due 11:59PM November 13

A company buys rods of different lengths in wholesale and sells them in pieces of different lengths.
Write programs, in two different languages, that will take a list of prices for different lengths, and
the total length. The programs will print all possible cuts for the given length that will yield 
maximum profit. Also print the maximum profit value.

For example, given a rod of length 4" and prices for different lengths:
1" - $1
2" - $4
3" - $4
4" - $5

The following are the cuts for maximum profit of $8: (2 2)
In general, there could be more than one possible combination of cuts.

Terms that you will run into are dynamic programming, optimization problem, etc. Some details here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem>. To solve this, you would want to find the max of max.

Write the program in a statically typed language and in a dynamically typed language. Honor total immutability.
Create build file, create in increments, with test first development.
