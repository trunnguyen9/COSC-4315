Assignment 3: Due 11:59PM October 30

We're going to design and implement a DSLâ€”Domain Specific Language in this assignment.
The syntax for the DSL will be influenced by the languages we use.

Design a DSL in two different languages, one statically typed and the other dynamically typed.

The DSL will be used to make a Pizza object. The syntax has to be highly fluent (not feel like code),
have less noise, read more like English. The syntax will vary depending on the capability of the 
languages used, but here's one example:

create Pizza
  spread sauce
  spread cheese
  toppings onions, jalapenos, green_pepper
  spread cheese
  bake

Running this code should print the details of the pizza that was created: what's in each layer (sauce, cheese, toppings names, and cheese).

You could have variations to the pizza being made, for example, add other toppings. Try out a couple of 
different examples in your tests.

Create build files and write code in increments after writing test first. Ask for frequent reviews, 
start with one language first, get that done before switching to the next language.

Total [100]: 99
Language 1:
DSL is fluent [15]:
All tests pass  [10]:
Code implements the fluent dsl [15]:
Code quality [10]:
Language 2:
DSL is fluent [15]:
All tests pass  [10]:
Code implements the fluent dsl [15]: Keep dsl designed consistent with what's implemented with vs. as - as does not make sense from fluency point of view
Code quality [10]:
