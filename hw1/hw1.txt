Files you check in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. 
Each of you are expected to put in your reasonable share of effort into it.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat.

Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. So, if you break code (in assignments) before the deadline, you will lose.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews (see the readme.txt file in the reviews folder for details on how to ask for reviews).

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews to your pair and to other pairs in the course.
Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.

Homework 1: Due 11:59PM September 4th

What are the differences between statements and expressions. Given examples. What are the benefits and the consequences of using each one of them. 

Feel free to read up, but do provide references to where you learn from. The description should be in your own words. If you find some really catchy phrases or quotes you'd like to use, do so, but put them in double quotes along with the name of who said (wrote) it.

Share your own experiences, observations, things that may have intrigued you.

Your answer goes here:

Statements are the most elementary instructions in programming languages. Statements instruct the underlying computer to perform some actions, but do not return values. Statements can consist of multiple statements.

Example of single statement: 
if(conditions) else do-something
a = a + 1

Example of compound statement:
{
	temp = a
	a = b
	b = temp
}

Similar to statements, expressions also cause some actions to be performed. However, expression evaluates to a value. Expressions can consist of multiple expressions. A statement is complete line of code (or several lines of code) to perform some actions, while an expression is any section of the code which evaluates to a value. So, expression can be used as statement, while statement cannot be used as expression.

Example of single expression:
a + 1
a + b

Example of compound expression:
a + b + (c / 10)

Example of statements consisting of expressions:
a = a + 10 + b / 10
a = a – b – c * 10

Expressions have some benefits over statements. One of them is that expressions are safer than statements. Since expressions return values, they do not cause expected changes to the state of the system. Another benefit is that expressions can be passed to functions.

Example of expressions passed to functions:
sum = add(10 + a, 10 – b)

add(int a, int b){
	return a + b
}

One significant limitation of statements, compared to expressions, is that it is very hard to have the same statements executed in parallel. It does not mean that it is impossible to do so, but programmers need to pay extra cautions. The reason is that statements can modify the state of the system. On the other hand, parallel executions of the same expressions are quite safe. It is because expressions do not change the state of the system. The instances of an expression are indepedent of one another. Therefore, their executions do not affect one another and can be done safely.
