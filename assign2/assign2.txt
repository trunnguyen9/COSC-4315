Assignment 2: Due 11:59PM October 2nd

Use a statically typed language and a dynamically typed language that natively supports (not an extension) tail recursion
for all the problems below. You may want to start with one problem, solve it, ask for reviews, and complete, before moving
to the next problem. Provide automated build script to run the tests.

The Fibonacci series is defined as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 26,... where a value at a position is defined as the sum of values at
previous two position. The values at position 0 and 1 are 1.

Given a position n (assume n >= 0), create functions that return the series using

1. a regular recursion

2. a tail recursion

Total [100]: 100
