Fibonacci Value (statically typed): Honor total immutability to solve this problem (no value or object should be modified once created). The Fibonacci value fib(position), where position (>= 0), is defined as fib(position - 1) + fib(position - 2). The value at positions 0 and 1 are both equal to 1. Write a fully-working program (separate file with proper extension), using a statically typed language. Write a fib function, along with any supporting functions, to compute the Fibonacci value at a given position. Use memoization in the solution to speed up the computation. Run the function for a sample position of 400.
