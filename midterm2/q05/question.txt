Factors: The factors of a number are all the numbers that can fully divide the given number. For example, 1, 2, 4, and 8 are factors of 8. Given a list of numbers, for example [2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 18, 15], write a function that takes the list as its parameter and returns a list of factors for all numbers in the given list. The result is a union of the factors for all the numbers in the parameter list. For example, if the input list was [2, 6], the result would be [1, 2, 3, 6]. Write your code in a dynamically typed language and honor total immutability. Keep the code highly concise.

def getFactors(number)
    (1..number).to_a.select {|e| number % e == 0}
end

def unionFactors(numbers)
    numbers.inject([]) {|result, e| result + getFactors(e) }.uniq
end

unionFactors([2, 4, 6, 8]).each {|e| puts e}
