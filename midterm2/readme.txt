Academic Honesty: Please read this carefully to avoid issues later.
The midterm is a joint work between you and your pair. Do not consult with
any other pairs in the class while working on the midterm. Do not seek
help from anyone else (other than your pair) during the midterm.
You may refer to information on the web, but do not exchange code or discuss
electronically (or in person) with anyone other than your pair during the midterm.

Students caught *giving* code to or *taking* code from other pairs in previous semesters
have received failing grade in the course and went through academic dishonesty proceedings. 
Donâ€™t let that happen to you.



The midterm has ten questions, each carrying equal points. Please answer each 
question in their individual directories. You can create any files necessary 
for each question in their respective directories. Files outside the 
directories for each question will not be graded.


                        
Please check in your answers frequently so you don't lose them.
You can check them in any number of times. Only the last check in for each 
question will be used for grading purpose. The svn repository will accept your 
checkins until 8:30PM.
