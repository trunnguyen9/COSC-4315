This code is not in any specific language; it's a pseudo-code.

values = [1, 2, 3]
factor = 4
values.foreach { e -> print(e * factor) }
factor = 7

Is the lambda expression / closure passed to foreach a pure function?
Explain, giving reason for your observation.


It is not a pure function. It is because it has printed something to an output terminal. Printing something to an output terminal is considered side effect. A pure function does not allow side effect.
